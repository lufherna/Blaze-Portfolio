			<p> Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Luis Hernandez and i'm a Web Developer. Working with technology, creating web apps, talking to other developers and coming up with ideas are some of things i enjoy.</p>
			<br>
			<p> I went to school initially for networking and it made me realize how broad the technology field is. I've done Helpdesk Support and Network Administration for some time, however i wanted to expand my knowledge in another field within technology. There is always something to learn and a person is only limited to their desire to learn</p>
			<br>
			<p> What i decided to do is go back to school and learn Web Development. It has opened opportunities for me that wouldn't have been available, had i stayed in my previous job. Right now i'm enjoying what i've learned and i love helping people with their sites</p>
			<br>
			<p> When I'm not working I'm either: at the gym, going out for a drink (an Old Fashioned is my favorite), traveling out of state, or studying coding. You can contact me with the info provided on this page. Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
